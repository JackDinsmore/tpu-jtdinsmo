    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to determine the relative speeds of training MNIST on CPUs and GPUs, as well as the relative speeds of inference. We will do this both for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and for Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) implementations of MNIST. It is similar to one of the experiments described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.08986.pdf) (arXiv:1904.08986v1 \\[physics.data-an\\]). The next step in this process will be to transform the code in this notebook into bare `tensorflow` code and compare the runtime between that and this `keras` implementation, and again between CPUs and GPUs in bare `tensorflow`. Then we will set the GPU implementation of MNIST up as a service. Ultimately, we look forward to running MNIST on TPUs and comparing runtime again.\n",

    "The code for the implementations of mnist using MLP with `keras` were pulled from [this github](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_mlp.py), and the code for the CNN impementation was pulled from [this file](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py) on the same github. I significantly changed both so that they would be more comparable."

    "## Creating MNIST\n",
    "\n",
    "Having imported all the necessary modules and defined the constants, we need to implement MNIST in `keras`. Since we plan to implement MNIST with MLP and with CNN, we will first create a parent class holding the common functions of both. Later, we will define two subclasses, one for MLP and once for CNN. The parent class has several functions:\n",
    "- `_load` and `_finish_load` load the default `keras` MNIST dataset in whatever form MLP or CNN wants the data to be in.\n",
    "- `_get_batch_sizes` sets a list of all the batch sizes to test. Because CNN uses so much memory, we will need to test smaller batch sizes or else the machine will crash. However, for the MLP implementation, we can train on very high batch sizes. Hence the batch sizes will be different for each case.\n",
    "- `_create` creates the MNIST model with a specific batch size.\n",
    "- `_load_inferences` loads several randomly generated images to be inferred on.\n",
    "- `_train` trains the MNIST model, keeping track of the time it takes to do so, and returns that time. The time it returns is actually the time to train _per iteration_, where one iteration is the number of epochs times the number of data points divided by the batch size.\n",
    "- `_predict` runs a number of inferences equal to the batch size the model was trained on and returns the time per inference. It does this multiple times to reduce uncertainty.\n",
    "- `get_data` runs all of the above functions in order to get the train times and inference times for the given machine type and implementation (MLP or CNN) for all the batch sizes`."
